Overall, the results showed that the diesel-biodiesel-methanol blends showed an increase in BSFC and Brake thermal efficiency. CO emission of blends was seen to be comparatively lower than mineral diesel. CO2 and HC emission was observed to be increasing for blends when compared with diesel. While NOx emission had a decrease in value compared to diesel.<a href="Finalrpt.pdf">{Cick here to view the report}</a>
